Description: The patternogram represents the average dissimilarity between the set of values in the given locations as a function of spatial distances between them. It is allows to: detect spatial autocorrelation for many data structures; compare spatial autocorrelation of variables over time; explore spatial autocorrelations of predictors in spatial machine learning models; analyze spatial autocorrelation of categorical spatial patterns.
